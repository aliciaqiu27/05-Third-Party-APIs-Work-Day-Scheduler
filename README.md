# 05-Third-Party-APIs-Work-Day-Scheduler


##  Using Third Party APIs to Create a Work Day Planner
The library [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/) was used to grab the date and times from the third-party API. The purpose of this project is to help a busy client to create a daily planner to create a work schedule. The planner displays the current date at the top of the planner, along with different time blocks from 9AM-5PM, which is color-color to indicate what time is in relative to now (past, present, or future). In addition, the User can write anything in the time block and click on the save button to retrieve the input even after refreshing the page.


## Usage 

1) Open the Index.html file with Chrome/Firefox web browsers:
2) The hours in the planner is color-coded based on past(gray), present(coral), future(green) relative to now. 
1) Click one of the time blocks and type in anything you want to plan during that hour. Then, click on the "Save" button to have your input saved and see in the future, even after refreshing the page! See [How To Use Demo](How-To-Use.PNG).
